This project delved into the world of Netflix shows, using text clustering techniques to unlock hidden connections. I grouped shows based on their descriptions, ensuring those within a cluster share similar themes, genres, or styles. This allows us to explore the vast Netflix library more effectively and identify shows viewers might enjoy based on their past preferences.

Content Treasure Trove: I Dived into a dataset of 7,787 records, each described by 11 informative attributes.
Data prep & exploration: Our journey began by cleaning the data and performing EDA to get a feel for the Netflix shows and Movies.
Netflix Unveiled: Movies Reign, Shows on the Rise! :Data reveals Netflix boasts more movies, with new shows rapidly joining the party. Interestingly, US-made content dominates the show selection.
Untangling the Netflix Universe: To group similar shows together, I focused on key attributes like cast, genre, and director. Then, a special technique called TF-IDF transformed these details into numerical data, making it easier for our analysis to reveal hidden connections.
Unveiling the Show Similarities: A TF-IDF Adventure!: While TF-IDF initially created a massive web of 10,000 features to capture the show descriptions, we encountered the "curse of dimensionality." To combat this, I employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a clever technique that identified the most important features. Remarkably, just 3,000 components were able to hold onto over 80% of the information! By focusing on these key elements, I streamlined the data and empowered our analysis to find hidden relationships between these fascinating Netflix shows.
Finding the Perfect Fit: K-Means Unveils 6 Show Clusters: To group shows with similar characteristics, I used K-Means clustering. But how many clusters? By analyzing the "elbow method" and "Silhouette score," I discovered 6 clusters provided the most optimal fit for organizing the Netflix shows!
Branching Out - Unveiling 7 Show Groups with Hierarchical Clustering: I also explored hierarchical clustering to discover natural groupings. By examining the branching structure of the dendrogram, I identified 7 optimal clusters, offering an alternative lens into the Netflix show landscape.
Finding Your Next Binge - Unveiling a Content-Based Recommendation System!: I built a recommendation system that understands shows! It uses a technique called "cosine similarity" to analyze show descriptions and recommend 10 similar options based on what you've watched before.
